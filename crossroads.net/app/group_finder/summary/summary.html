        <h3>Brave Groups</h3>

        <h3>Host a group</h3>
        <p>
          Anyone can be a host. Anyone. We will give you the materials. You just have to supply the meeting space, and a little bit of guidance for your group. God will take care of the rest. <br><br>

          You can do it! <br>
          Hosting a BRAVE group is like hosting a dinner party. Only you don't have to supply food and we supply the dinner conversation. <br>
          You'll tell us how many you can host.  <br>
          You tell us where and when. <br>
          We'll get people signed up for your group and can invite people if you like. <br>
          We'll give you the material. You just need to follow the directions. <br>
